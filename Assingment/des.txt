Write a Python script that pulls data from the APIs. Use Object-Oriented Programming 
(OOP) principles to ensure your code is modular, reusable, and easy to maintain. Also,
 use the last digit of the phone number you used to register during the orientation 
 day to select the API project you are to work with. E.g. a phone number 08000340204 
 would select the No.4 - CoinGecko Project. 

 
If you fail to follow any of the instructions, it is as good as not doing the 
assignment. Your assignment would be presented during this week’s Saturday’s class so
 ensure you finish on time.
